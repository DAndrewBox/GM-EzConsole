## üÜï Setting up on a new project

To setup the extension on a new project, you shouldn't need to do anything special.

Just import the extension and you should be good to go. :)

---

## üß∞ Setting up on an existing project

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you already installed this extension before and have custom commands callbacks or functions on the `ezConsole_custom_commands` script, **you should not import the `ezConsole_custom_commands` on step 1**.

If you want to set up the extension on an existing project, you can do so by following these steps:

1. Import the extension into your project. (See [Installation](#installation))
2. Make sure you have the `GM-EzConsole` folder in your project.
3. Make sure you have the `__EzConsole__` object in your `EzConsole\Objects` folder.
4. Make sure you have the `GM-EzConsole` folder, and the following files: `default_commands.json`, `default-dark.skin` and `default-light.skin` files
   in your `Included Files` folder (or try to find it on your `datafiles` project folder).
5. If you have the `ezConsole_autocreate` flag deactivated (see [Features customization](#features-customization)), then place the `__EzConsole__` object in the first room of your project.
6. Run your project and press `F1` _(by default)_ to open the console.
7. If you can see the console window, you're good to go.
