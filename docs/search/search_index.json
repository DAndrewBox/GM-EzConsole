The commands are imported automatically when the extension is imported into your project and are saved in the default_commands.json file. If you want to disable the import of the base commands, you can do so by removing \"default_commands.json\" from the _files_to_load array on the ezConsole_init script and deleting the default_commands.json file. The following table shows the list of base commands: Command Description Arguments Required arguments help Show the list of commands. [command] [false] show Makes something visible on screen. [fps/overlay] [true] hide Makes something invisible on screen. [fps/overlay] [true] message Shows a message on screen and pauses the game. [message] [true] fullscreen Toggles fullscreen mode. [0/1] [true] game Choose to end or restart the game. [end/reset] [true] create Create an object. [object_name, x, y, depth] [true, false, false, false] instances Show the list of active instances. [object_name] [true] Custom commands The commands should have this format: { \"name\": \"command_name\", \"short\": \"command_short_name\", \"desc\": \"Short description of the command\", \"args\": [\"argument_name\"], \"req\": [\"true or false\"], \"values\": [\"Short description of the argument in the same index\"], \"callback\": \"Function to call when the command is executed\" } You can see an example of a command on the default_commands.json file. The following table shows the meaning of each field: Field Description Required name The name of the command. Yes short The short name of the command. No (use \"-\" to disable) desc The description of the command. No args The arguments of the command. No req False if the argument is optional, true otherwise. No (Yes if there's at least 1 argument) values The description of the arguments. No (Yes if there's at least 1 argument) callback The function to call when the command is executed. Yes Import custom commands from file If you want to import custom commands from a file, you can do so by following these steps: Create a new file with the .json extension. Add the commands you want to import to the file. Add the filename to the _files_to_load array on the ezConsole_init script. Create a callback function for each command you want to import on the ezConsole_custom_commands script. Run your project and press F1 to open the console. Type help to see the list of commands. You should see the commands you imported. If you don't, check if you followed the steps correctly and the file is in the correct folder. Import custom commands from code If you want to import custom commands from code, you can do so by following these steps: Adding commands using the custom commands script: (Recommended) Open the ezConsole_custom_commands script. Create the callback functions for the commands you want to import. At the end of the file, use the console_add_command function to add the commands you want to import. This function has the following format: console_add_command(command_struct); where command_struct is a struct with Custom Commands fields. Run your project and press F1 to open the console. Type help to see the list of commands. This is an example of how to use the console_add_command function: console_add_command({ name: \"fps\", short: \"-\", desc: \"Show fps\", args: [\"flag\"], req: [true], values: [\"Boolean flag to enable or disable the fps counter.\"], callback: \"show_fps\", }); Now you should see the commands you imported. If you don't, check if you followed the steps correctly. Adding commands directly to the global array: (Not recommended) As a last resort, you can try to add the commands directly to the global array. This is not recommended, but it's possible. Open the ezConsole_custom_init script. Add the commands you want to import to the global.__debug_console_commands array. Create a callback function for each command you want to import on the ezConsole_custom_commands script. Run your project and press F1 to open the console. Type help to see the list of commands.

(Be sure you are downloading the correct version for your GameMaker version. Check the compatible versions in this table.) (A) Import the contents into your project just draggin the GM-EzConsole-[version].yymps file into it. (B) You can also import it into your project using the top toolbar on Tools > Import Local Package > Select the GM-EzConsole-[version].yymps file. A window should appear asking you to select the resources you want to import. Select the GML-EzConsole folder, press Add All , and then click Import . You can now use the extension in your project. Setting up on a new project To setup the extension on a new project, you shouldn't need to do anything special. Just import the extension and you're good to go. :) Setting up on an existing project IMPORTANT NOTE: If you already installed this extension before and have custom commands callbacks or functions on the ezConsole_custom_commands script, you should not import the ezConsole_custom_commands on step 1. If you want to set up the extension on an existing project, you can do so by following these steps: Import the extension into your project. (See Installation ) Make sure you have the GML-EzConsole folder in your project. Make sure you have the __debug_console__ object in your Objects folder. Make sure you have the default_commands.json file in your Included Files folder (or try to find it on your datafiles project folder). Place the __debug_console__ object in the first room of your project. Run your project and press F1 to open the console. If you can see a console window, you're good to go. Create your first command On this section, you will learn how to create your first command. This command will be called trace and will print a message on the console. To create your first command, you can do so by following these steps: 1) Open the ezConsole_custom_commands script file in your project. 2) Create a new function inside this file with the following name console_command_trace . /// @func console_command_trace(args) /// @param {array} args function console_command_trace(_args) { // Your code here } 3) As you can see, the function name must start with console_command_ followed by the command name. In this case, the command name is trace . Inside the function, you should start by creating 4 variables, _command , _params_len , _min_params and _max_params , the first one will store the command name to be called and the second one will store the length of the _args array. var _command = \"trace\"; var _params_len = array_length(_args); var _min_params = 1; var _max_params = 99; // You can set this to the maximum number of params you want 4) Now, you should check if the _params_len is less than _min_params and grater than _max_params , if it is, you should print a message on the console telling the user that the command was called with the wrong number of params. if (_params_len < _min_params) { // Not enough params var _not_enough_text = console_get_message( EZ_CONSOLE_MSG.NOT_ENOUGH_PARAMS, _command, _params_len, _min_params, _max_params ); console_write_log(_not_enough_text, EZ_CONSOLE_MSG_TYPE.INFO); } else if (_params_len > _max_params) { // Too many params var _too_many_text = console_get_message( EZ_CONSOLE_MSG.TOO_MUCH_PARAMS, _command, _params_len, _min_params, _max_params ); console_write_log(_too_many_text, EZ_CONSOLE_MSG_TYPE.INFO); } 5) Now, we should check the \"happy path\", if the _params_len is between _min_params and _max_params , we should print the message on the console. So we add a new else case. else { var _message = \"\"; for (var i = 0; i < _params_len; i++) { _message += _args[i]; if (i < _params_len - 1) { _message += \" \"; } } console_write_log(_message, EZ_CONSOLE_MSG_TYPE.INFO); show_debug_message(_message); } 6) Now that the function is created, we should add it to the console_commands array. To do so, we should add a new element to the array with the following structure: { name: \"trace\", short: \"tr\", desc: \"Prints a message on the console\", args: [\"message\"], req: [true], values: [\"Message to be printed on the console\"], callback: \"console_command_trace\", } 7) Finally, we add it to the console_commands array by declaring it at the end of the ezConsole_custom_commands file (and outside of the function) like this: console_add_command({ name: \"trace\", short: \"tr\", desc: \"Prints a message on the console\", args: [\"message\"], req: [true], values: [\"Message to be printed on the console\"], callback: \"console_command_trace\", }); 8) Now, you can run your project and type trace on the console, followed by a message. If everything went well, you should see the message on the GameMaker's console and on the EzConsole. The final code should look like this: /// @func console_command_trace(args) /// @param {array} args function console_command_trace(_args) { var _command = \"trace\"; var _params_len = array_length(_args); var _min_params = 1; var _max_params = 99; // You can set this to the maximum number of params you want if (_params_len < _min_params) { // Not enough params var _not_enough_text = console_get_message( EZ_CONSOLE_MSG.NOT_ENOUGH_PARAMS, _command, _params_len, _min_params, _max_params ); console_write_log(_not_enough_text, EZ_CONSOLE_MSG_TYPE.INFO); } else if (_params_len > _max_params) { // Too many params var _too_many_text = console_get_message( EZ_CONSOLE_MSG.TOO_MUCH_PARAMS, _command, _params_len, _min_params, _max_params ); console_write_log(_too_many_text, EZ_CONSOLE_MSG_TYPE.INFO); } else { var _message = \"\"; for (var i = 0; i < _params_len; i++) { _message += _args[i]; if (i < _params_len - 1) { _message += \" \"; } } console_write_log(_message, EZ_CONSOLE_MSG_TYPE.INFO); show_debug_message(_message); } } console_add_command({ name: \"trace\", short: \"tr\", desc: \"Prints a message on the console\", args: [\"message\"], req: [true], values: [\"Message to be printed on the console\"], callback: \"console_command_trace\", }); You can also skip the steps 7 & 8 by adding the commands via file.
